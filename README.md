### Overview
This is a project created using simple state machines that navigates through the mastery of different elements to become the master of all elements. 

This project is inspired by "Avatar the Last Airbender" and the sequences of the series. 

### Technical Details

1. The Clickable class is utilized here to make certain aspects of the class clickable. 

2. There are different state changes that the user can navigate through by following the instructions on the screen and either pressing the buttons or clicking objects with their mouse.


### How it works

1. The user is greeted by a welcome screen that is followed by instructions. 

2. By clicking on the different elemental sigils, you navigate through learning how to bend the different elements. 

3. Combining all the elements leads to the final stage where you are the master of all the elements.
